The house is a two-storage home with a basement. Your room is on the second floor (or the floor just above the main floor). As you go through the house pass through the living first by going straight ahead (once you have entered the living room). After crossing the living room and dining room, you will enter the kitchen. As you go through the kitchen take your right as you face the kitchen table. You will then enter the office immediately after taking your right. Once you are in the office keep going and eventually go upstairs. Once you reach upstairs your room will be the door on your right (not the door on your left).

Unlocking your door: Unlocking your door takes 3 steps:
1. Press the "Yale" sign (or button) on your lock.
2. Enter your code
3. Press the check mark sign (or button).
After that, your door should unlock.

Locking your door: Locking your door takes 3 steps:
1. Close the door tight enough by holding the doorknob and pulling it toward you until the door is firmly closed.
2. While holding the doorknob press the "Yale" sign (button) on your smart lock.
3. Listen for the locking notification sound and watch your lock for the
locking notification blinking lights: the lights on your smart lock will blink. If
you hear the locking sound and see the blinking lights on, then the door is
locked successfully.
After that, your door should lock.
