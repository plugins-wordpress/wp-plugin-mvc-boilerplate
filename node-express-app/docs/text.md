Hello McKayla,

I hope this message finds you well. It was an absolute pleasure meeting you at church today! I was genuinely impressed to learn about your study as an graphic designer â€“ it sounds truly captivating! ðŸ˜Š I'm eager to hear more about your study; could you share some insights into your experiences?

The grathering with friends has been posponed. Jessica, the host, her brother's wife had a new baby and she is going to be helping. However, How about we continue our conversation over Sweataly Gelato or SOMI Vietnamese Bistro this tuesday or wednesay? I propose meeting at 1527 S 1500 E for Sweataly Gelato or 1215 Wilmington Ave Suite 100, Salt Lake City, UT 84106, Salt Lake City, UT 84105 around 5pm or 6pm. Does that fit into your schedule?

Of course, I'm flexible and open to your suggestions as well, so feel free to let me know your preferences.

I genuinely enjoyed our conversation today and am excited about the possibility of getting to know you better.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!
Warm regards,
Ericson
