"Hey Katelyn!

I hope your day is going great. ðŸ˜Š I wanted to say how much I've enjoyed our time together and the conversations we've had. You bring such a positive and interesting energy into my life, and I'm really looking forward to getting to know you even better.

By the way, I came across this "A Tale Dark & Grimm" on netflix (it a series) and somewhow thought  of you and thought you might find it intriguing or interesting or scary.  Have you seen about it?

Also, I was wondering if you'd be up for a sweataly gelato or hot chocolate on 1500 E 1500 S this Saturday evening or this comming tuesday evening. For the hot chocolate we can have it on 1500 E 1500 S or I can make us a traditional home make hot chocolate. No pressure, just thought it could be fun. Let me know what you think!

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead!

Thank you very much for sharing about your parents! I appreciate, it means a lot to me Arriella. I just want to let know you that I will here for you not matter what happens: whether I am happilly married or not or wether you are happilly married or not. I will always be here for you if you want to talk to you. And this is completely independent of our relationship or maretal statuses (wether we are married to other people or not). I want you to talk to me if you even want someone to talk to or someone to listen to. 


For some reason I was not able to show you or tell you some of the things I do. But here is something, if you ever want refresher or you and Will want to get away for a few days, please let me know. You or you and Will comee come here for a weekend or few days and stay in one of my private rooms. I do airbnb with these private rooms, but you or you and Will even want to stay here for a get away, just let know and  you or you two can still away. If you or you and Will decide to stay here for a get away, please do not worry about the price tag on airbnb, I will just make sure you stay here at no cost.


Thank you, Melissa. I will sure get the paystubs to you. However, I want to make sure I understand it well; ByÂ "between the dates of 08/14 and 11/14" you mean between the dates August 14th  2023 and November 14th, 2023?  Something else?
