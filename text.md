"Hey Katelyn!

I hope your day is going great. ðŸ˜Š I wanted to say how much I've enjoyed our time together and the conversations we've had. You bring such a positive and interesting energy into my life, and I'm really looking forward to getting to know you even better.

By the way, I came across this "A Tale Dark & Grimm" on netflix (it a series) and somewhow thought  of you and thought you might find it intriguing or interesting or scary.  Have you seen about it?

Also, I was wondering if you'd be up for a sweataly gelato or hot chocolate on 1500 E 1500 S this Saturday evening or this comming tuesday evening. For the hot chocolate we can have it on 1500 E 1500 S or I can make us a traditional home make hot chocolate. No pressure, just thought it could be fun. Let me know what you think!

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead!
