oh okay, I understand now. And you and I right there with you: Love is very significant and the most siginificant; and it should be. It's normal and ok too to feel nervous about it. I think it's important to fall in love as hard as you can when you can and when you feel like it and leave the rest to life itself. Also sometimes by falling in love as hard as you can help the other person to fall in love equally as hard as you.
